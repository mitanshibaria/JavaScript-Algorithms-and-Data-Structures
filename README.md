# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

Developers use HTML and CSS to control the content and styling of a page. And they use JavaScript to make that page interactive.

In JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures, I learnt the JavaScript fundamentals like variables, arrays, objects, loops, functions, the DOM and more.

I also learnt about Object Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming, algorithmic thinking, how to work with local storage, and how to fetch data using an API.
